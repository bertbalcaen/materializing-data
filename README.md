# Turning Data into Matter - ITP Camp 2014 workshop

### Step-by-step setup

* Download Processing 2
  * for OS X 16.8 Snow Leopard, use Processing 2.0.2: https://code.google.com/p/processing/downloads/list
  * for above OS X 16.8, download the latest Processing: https://processing.org/download/
* Download this code ("Download ZIP" button to the right)
* Open the data file (/data/2014/campers.csv) and replace the data with your own. 
  * Be careful to remove whitespaces around commas, and to wrap strings in double quotes ("Firstname Lastname").
* Run the sketch.
* Press 'p' to create a PDF of the viz.
* Put the PDF on a USB dongle and load it in the laser cutter (ask a councelor if necessary).
* Laser cut your stuff!

### Going further

* EASY PEASY: project about mapping running data to a medal with similar Processing code that creates a final laser-cut artefact.
  * http://www.theworldneedsmoredreamers.net/personalized-medals-for-runners-v2/
* INTERMEDIATE: another Processing project that eases some GUI tools (graphical user interface) to have sliders in your sketch to control some parameters.
  * 
* ADVANCED: And another personal Processing project that creates a 3D form instead, for 3D printing.
