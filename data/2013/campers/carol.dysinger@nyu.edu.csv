We&#8217;ll review some of the coding from Arduino 101 and then move onto variables, for loops, while loops, and writing your own functions.","I will be there. I want to follow along.

Many of us know what it&#8217;s like to witness a new project with cutting-edge tech only to feel disappointed, likening the experience more to a technical demo than something poignant and worth remembering. This may happen with projects of any nature, of course, but tech projects are especially prone to the pitfall of gadgetry taking precedence over meaning.","Carol Dysinger is coming!!!"
