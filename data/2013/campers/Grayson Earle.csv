How can you bring a visualization sketch you wrote in Processing into MAX/MSP/Jitter or VDMX? Syphon! How can you control multiple applications at once from a touch screen? TouchOSC! My experience in using these devices and programs is derived from VJing (can we come up with a better term, please?) So we can talk about that, too. I think a fair amount of time at the end will be dedicated to a discussion about using the Kinect&#8217;s raw depth data, but we will not talk about OpenNI as I have no experience with that.",http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/jittersyphonkinect-followup/

This workshop is for people that already have a little bit of experience with iOS (and Arduino). We&#8217;ll start off with the classic hardware &#8220;Hello World&#8221; project to blink an LED connected to to an Arduino, but this time we&#8217;ll do it from your iPhone.",yuh

"Coding in Assembly",15,"4:30 pm","June 15, 2013 @ 4:30 pm – 7:30 pm",mail@tristanperich.com,10,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/perich_assembly/?instance_id=831,"Tristan Perich presents an introductory workshop on hardware programming in Assembly, providing an understanding of how these systems function at their lowest level. As the technology in our lives becomes faster and more complicated, our understanding of it has decreased, forcing us to put an implicit faith in its design, inner workings and safety. While Perich&#8217;s work aims to integrate low-level computation with traditional artistic media, this workshop intends to teach a basic understanding of Assembly, a low-level programming language that drives most hardware at its foundation. The workshop is intended for those with a basic understanding of computer programming, though it is not necessary. Participants will learn how to program an Amtel microprocessor, a low-cost, highly versatile microchip similar to those used in Arduino boards and in Perich&#8217;s own 1-Bit Symphony.",rsvp
