"iOS Boot Camp",7,"4:00 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 4:00 pm – 7:00 pm",Roopa,19,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/ios-boot-camp-2/?instance_id=765,"Getting started with the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch using Apple&#8217;s native development tools. This is a three hour hands on workshop session that should get you beyond the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; stage and leave you with code running on you device and on to the interesting stuff. We&#8217;ll hopefully move on to playing around with the onboard sensors, or perhaps the map and location frameworks, depending on what people in the class would rather do with the time.","I&#8217;m in!"
"Smart Dust – is it inevitable?",9,"1:00 pm","June 9, 2013 @ 1:00 pm – 2:00 pm","Alasdair Allan",14,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/smart-dust-is-it-inevitable/?instance_id=766,"I&#8217;d argue that the era of the commodity beige box is coming to an end, and the days of the general purpose computer are almost over. Most people never needed or wanted a computer, and they&#8217;re going to be happy with more limited devices optimised for a single, or a few, purposes so long as those devices just work. Today the black rectangle has replaced the beige box, but don&#8217;t get too comfortable, because it won&#8217;t last as long. Today&#8217;s cellphones and tablets are transition devices, dependent on our current level of technological progress, and around you everyday objects are already becoming smarter.","I&#8217;m in"

"Introduction to Distributed Sensor Networks",15,"2:00 pm","June 15, 2013 @ 2:00 pm – 6:00 pm","Alasdair Allan",41,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-distributed-sensor-networks/?instance_id=993,"Sensors are the future of distributed data. General-purpose computing is dissipating and becoming increasingly embedded into our lives. We will soon begin to move in a sea of data, our movements monitored and our environments measured and adjusted to our preferences, without need for direct intervention.","In Please!"
