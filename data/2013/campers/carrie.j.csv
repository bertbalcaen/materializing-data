But how might we use electricity to change the idea of what &#8220;interactive&#8221; books can be? In this session, participants will create pop-up cards that use the affordances of our materials to really investigate how circuits can change the idea of what a book can be. We&#8217;ll also consider where soft circuits are going by looking at examples in toys and wearable technologies.","I&#8217;ll be there!"
