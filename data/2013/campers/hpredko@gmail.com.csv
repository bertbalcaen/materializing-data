I will begin by showing examples of site-specific and video mapping pieces and then we will map a real building using a spatial scan in Mad Mapper. For homework each camper will get a scan to work from and some tips on how to create giant projections. Part 2 of the session will allow campers to showcase their mapped work projected 3 stories tall on an actual building on broadway.",Attending!

I&#8217;ve recently come to realize that a large part of my increased comfort level with electronics derives from a shift in perspective; no longer do I simply see a lonely rusted bike wheel littering my neighborhood, but raw materials such as spokes that make great axles for rotating propellers and mirrors. The VCR I found outside my friend&#8217;s studio became a drawer of motors, buttons, and a tape reader that now scans discarded video tapes in tandem with that bike tire! So for this session I&#8217;d like to lead a conceptual and hands on workshop in which we dream up ways to use discarded electronics (which I will provide). What inventive ways will we think to use an air mattress pump? A robotic aerosol sprayer? A game involving a levitating object? The possibilities are vast and can only improve with a conceptual shift concerning everyday objects.",attending

This session is a crash course in the commercialization arc that includes product development, validation, and commercial ramp up.  Issues that arise in these post-prototype stages are important design insights that will make your product idea stronger. We’ll get into practical examples of how to connect with funding sources, user communities, and manufacturers while sharing resources that’ll be ready and waiting once camp is over.",Attending!
