It is used in performance and installations by artists, composers, and people just like you!",attending
"VJ demo/workshop",7,"12:00 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 12:00 pm – 1:30 pm","Grayson Earle",10,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/vj-demoworkshop/?instance_id=798,"Since there are so many tools being presented at camp I&#8217;d like to demo a few ways to make them talk to one another. How can you bring a visualization sketch you wrote in Processing into MAX/MSP/Jitter or VDMX? Syphon! How can you control multiple applications at once from a touch screen? TouchOSC! My experience in using these devices and programs is derived from VJing (can we come up with a better term, please?) So we can talk about that, too. I think a fair amount of time at the end will be dedicated to a discussion about using the Kinect&#8217;s raw depth data, but we will not talk about OpenNI as I have no experience with that.","I&#8217;ll be there &#8211; thanks"
"AT&amp;T AdWorks Lab Tour",7,"3:30 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 3:30 pm – 5:00 pm","David Polinchock",30,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/att-adworks-lab-tour/?instance_id=743,"I&#8217;ll give a quick and informal tour of the AdWorks Media Lab.  We&#8217;ll look at how we used Cinder to create some very cool (at least we think so!) data visualizations and explain how we developed the narrative for the entire space.  You can see the pool table that will soon be transformed into a completely, interactive experience!    Lastly, you&#8217;ll also get a sneak peek at the redesign that we&#8217;re currently doing that will launch in September.","I&#8217;d like to come please"

"Akimitsu Sadoi &#8211; LED Artist Workshop",19,"5:30 pm","June 19, 2013 @ 5:30 pm – 7:00 pm","Ben Light",15,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/akimitsu-sadoi-led-artist-workshop/?instance_id=840,"Aki has offered to do a build workshop which should be quite fun and you&#8217;ll have something to take with you. It&#8217;s the simplest circuit with the least number of components (see image below). Yet it does share the same technical principle (multiplex LED drive with PWM) with more complex designs of his. He also think it&#8217;s a good material to get started with surface mount soldering.","Count me in please"
"Jitter-centric Weenie roast",20,"4:30 pm","June 20, 2013 @ 4:30 pm – 7:00 pm",Scott!,7,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/jitter-centric-weenie-roast/?instance_id=1139,"A bunch of people have asked for some specialized help with Max/Jitter to supplement the intro sessions Gabe and I have run. However, there&#8217;s little consensus on what people want to get out of it. Requests have come in for OpenGL help, video tracking, and affirmation of life goals.","If possible i would like to work through an example scenario  to code in Jitter from beginning to end &#8211; as a group code &#8211; to understand how to approach and solve coding problems. Especially using serial data (to and from arduino) and manipulating video with this data. I can come prepared with a  scenario to code&#8230;&#8230;.."
