How to turn your prototype into a product",18,"6:00 pm","June 18, 2013 @ 6:00 pm – 8:00 pm",sarahkrasley@gmail.com,17,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/2282-2/?instance_id=286,"When individuals and companies want to bring their product to the market, they run into hurdles like how to source materials, how to access a group of people who will buy it, and how to do it in a way that it doesn’t eat up all their savings and free time. This session is a crash course in the commercialization arc that includes product development, validation, and commercial ramp up.  Issues that arise in these post-prototype stages are important design insights that will make your product idea stronger. We’ll get into practical examples of how to connect with funding sources, user communities, and manufacturers while sharing resources that’ll be ready and waiting once camp is over.","Unfortunately can&#8217;t make it, please share any documents/links."
