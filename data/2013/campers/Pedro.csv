But how might we use electricity to change the idea of what &#8220;interactive&#8221; books can be? In this session, participants will create pop-up cards that use the affordances of our materials to really investigate how circuits can change the idea of what a book can be. We&#8217;ll also consider where soft circuits are going by looking at examples in toys and wearable technologies.","I&#8217;m in."

I&#8217;m excited to share the research that went into my recently published handbook on independent learning called Don&#8217;t Go Back to School, based on interviews with 100 independent learners. Let&#8217;s talk about how independent learning works, and how to get more people doing it and taking it seriously, and how it fits into the future of education, daily life, and the world we want to live in. My next contribution to the cause will be a set of guidelines for learning oriented working groups. I&#8217;d love to hear your approaches.",+1

Many of us know what it&#8217;s like to witness a new project with cutting-edge tech only to feel disappointed, likening the experience more to a technical demo than something poignant and worth remembering.
