"Introduction to Soft Circuits",6,"7:00 pm","June 6, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",kh928,52,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-soft-circuits/?instance_id=779,"In this class, we will go over conductive materials used in creating soft circuits, such as different thread, fabrics, inks and fasteners, along with looking at microcontrollers designed specifically for wearable electronics. Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.",Attending
"Sensing our surroundings : log sensor data using arduino",10,"7:00 pm","June 10, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",gabriella.levine@gmail.com,31,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/log-data-using-arduino/?instance_id=522,"This hands on workshop will address visualizing data input from Arduino. The context of the class will be based around open source semi-autonomous sailing robots called Protei, designed to sense &amp; clean oceans. After a brief introduction about Protei project, the remainder of the session will be devoted to understanding the very basics of sensing &amp; exploring the environment through collecting &amp; visualizing data using remote sensors, including sensors such as photocells, potentiometers, and more complex ones like barometers, GPS, and accelerometers.",Attending
"iOS and Serial Hardware",11,"4:00 pm","June 11, 2013 @ 4:00 pm – 6:00 pm","Alasdair Allan",17,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/2262-2/?instance_id=279,"A workshop on how to use the Redpark Serial Cable for iOS to talk to an Arduino, or any other bit of external hardware that talks RS-232 or TTL serial. This workshop is for people that already have a little bit of experience with iOS (and Arduino). We&#8217;ll start off with the classic hardware &#8220;Hello World&#8221; project to blink an LED connected to to an Arduino, but this time we&#8217;ll do it from your iPhone.",Attending

We’ll demystify the various different types of radios and wireless networks, work through a basic wireless serial connection and talk about direct pin access. I’ll provide loaner XBees, but if you’d like to bring your own, we’ll be using XBee Series 1 with Sparkfun’s XBee explorer. Also, please download Coolterm and FTDI drivers if you haven’t already.",Attending
"Introduction to Distributed Sensor Networks",15,"2:00 pm","June 15, 2013 @ 2:00 pm – 6:00 pm","Alasdair Allan",41,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-distributed-sensor-networks/?instance_id=993,"Sensors are the future of distributed data. General-purpose computing is dissipating and becoming increasingly embedded into our lives. We will soon begin to move in a sea of data, our movements monitored and our environments measured and adjusted to our preferences, without need for direct intervention.",attending
"From Story to Tech: a methodology project",17,"7:00 pm","June 17, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 9:00 pm",kh928,31,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/from-story-to-tech-a-methodology-project/?instance_id=345,"Often times, it seems that tech projects can come off as nothing more than technological masturbation. Many of us know what it&#8217;s like to witness a new project with cutting-edge tech only to feel disappointed, likening the experience more to a technical demo than something poignant and worth remembering. This may happen with projects of any nature, of course, but tech projects are especially prone to the pitfall of gadgetry taking precedence over meaning.",Attending
