I will begin by showing examples of site-specific and video mapping pieces and then we will map a real building using a spatial scan in Mad Mapper. For homework each camper will get a scan to work from and some tips on how to create giant projections. Part 2 of the session will allow campers to showcase their mapped work projected 3 stories tall on an actual building on broadway.","This was awesome. Thanks."
