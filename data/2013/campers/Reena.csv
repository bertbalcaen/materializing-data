I have built a rig for doing full body human scans. The rig builds on this turntable I built last year: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28454 We&#8217;ll cover my scanning technique then a workflow for taking scans to a printable mesh using Netfabb Basic. I can also touch on some tricks with Meshlab if we need to combine meshes, remesh or reduce polygon count.",tentative

So.cl is a creator network experiment by FUSE labs that provides tools to create, share and browse a range of media like memes, collages, and animated gifs  within people’s existing and new social networks. We’ll give a quick overview of So.cl, and the emerging creative tool app ecosystem built on top of it. We’ll conclude by breaking into groups for micro brainstorms to dream up the creative tools you’d like to have when you leave ITP camp. We’ll close the session with 2 minute lightening presentations by each of the groups.",attending
