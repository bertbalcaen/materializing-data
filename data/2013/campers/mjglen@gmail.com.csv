"Shop Safety!",4,"5:00 pm","June 4, 2013 @ 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm","Crys Moore",13,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/shop-safety-3/?instance_id=613,"Get Shop certified!","#12 Just in time!"
"Introduction to Soft Circuits",6,"7:00 pm","June 6, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",kh928,52,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-soft-circuits/?instance_id=779,"In this class, we will go over conductive materials used in creating soft circuits, such as different thread, fabrics, inks and fasteners, along with looking at microcontrollers designed specifically for wearable electronics. Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.",attending!
"VJ demo/workshop",7,"12:00 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 12:00 pm – 1:30 pm","Grayson Earle",10,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/vj-demoworkshop/?instance_id=798,"Since there are so many tools being presented at camp I&#8217;d like to demo a few ways to make them talk to one another. How can you bring a visualization sketch you wrote in Processing into MAX/MSP/Jitter or VDMX? Syphon! How can you control multiple applications at once from a touch screen? TouchOSC! My experience in using these devices and programs is derived from VJing (can we come up with a better term, please?) So we can talk about that, too. I think a fair amount of time at the end will be dedicated to a discussion about using the Kinect&#8217;s raw depth data, but we will not talk about OpenNI as I have no experience with that.",attttttending
"Intro to the Soft Lab",7,"6:30 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 6:30 pm – 7:30 pm",Roopa,18,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/intro-to-the-soft-lab/?instance_id=742,"This workshop will introduce you to the basics of using ITP&#8217;s soft lab resources &#8212; specifically the sewing machines, the embroidery machine, and the vinyl cutter.  This will mostly be a demo session, so no materials are required!",attending

"Really Big Video Part 1",11,"7:30 pm","June 11, 2013 @ 7:30 pm – 9:00 pm",gabebc@gmail.com,45,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/2427-2/?instance_id=373,"This session will introduce Big Building Mapping and Video Projection. I will begin by showing examples of site-specific and video mapping pieces and then we will map a real building using a spatial scan in Mad Mapper. For homework each camper will get a scan to work from and some tips on how to create giant projections. Part 2 of the session will allow campers to showcase their mapped work projected 3 stories tall on an actual building on broadway.",attending
