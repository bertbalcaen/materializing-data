"3D Scanning Workshop with the Kinect &amp; ReconstructMe",16,"12:00 pm","June 16, 2013 @ 12:00 pm – 2:00 pm",fredini@gmail.com,32,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/3d-scanning-workshop/?instance_id=946,"We&#8217;ll explore 3D scanning using an Xbox Kinect controller with ReconstructMe software, and the steps needed to convert these scans to 3D printable models. I have built a rig for doing full body human scans. The rig builds on this turntable I built last year: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28454 We&#8217;ll cover my scanning technique then a workflow for taking scans to a printable mesh using Netfabb Basic. I can also touch on some tricks with Meshlab if we need to combine meshes, remesh or reduce polygon count.","Very cool. I have been playing with this software, definitely coming!"
"Aerial Photography of Fresh Kills Landfill",22,"all day","June 22, 2013 all-day",nejohnson2@gmail.com,21,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/aerial-photography-of-fresh-kills-landfill/?instance_id=543,"Fresh Kills is one of the most infamous landfills in the United States containing all of New York city&#8217;s waste for over 50 years.  Visible from space and as large as the Great Wall of China, Fresh Kills is a New York secret located in Staten Island and currently being converted into a public park over the next thirty years.  Join us for a field trip to this epic landscape to discover the final resting place of our trash and experiment with aerial photography using kites and large helium balloons.  WIth these grassroots mapping techniques, we can begin to develop a high resolution map of the landfill, investigate vegetation growth and begin to better understand what happens to the things we throw away.","This looks great."
