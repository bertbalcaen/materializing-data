I have built a rig for doing full body human scans. The rig builds on this turntable I built last year: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28454 We&#8217;ll cover my scanning technique then a workflow for taking scans to a printable mesh using Netfabb Basic. I can also touch on some tricks with Meshlab if we need to combine meshes, remesh or reduce polygon count.","attending, and bringing my Kinect+Skanect to add more scanning options!"

As it turns out though, these come shipped as kits which have to be assembled, so we&#8217;re bringing it to camp and building it here! Using our collective skills we can probably build it pretty quickly. If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to get your hands dirty in building a 3D printer, join the Metropolitan Museum&#8217;s Jonathan Dahan and the Brooklyn Museum&#8217;s David Huerta in an adventure of crowdsourced construction!","I&#8217;m hoping to attend &#8212; and if I don&#8217;t attend, i&#8217;ll still be around to troubleshoot and tune in the days that follow the event!"
