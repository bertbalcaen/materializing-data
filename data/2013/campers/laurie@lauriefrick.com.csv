"Re-wiring for Re-cycling",13,"6:00 pm","June 13, 2013 @ 6:00 pm – 8:00 pm",kh928,14,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/re-wiring-for-re-cycling/?instance_id=183,"Physical Computing strikes me as a unique opportunity to recycle materials destined for landfill while creating unique objects and experiences. I&#8217;ve recently come to realize that a large part of my increased comfort level with electronics derives from a shift in perspective; no longer do I simply see a lonely rusted bike wheel littering my neighborhood, but raw materials such as spokes that make great axles for rotating propellers and mirrors. The VCR I found outside my friend&#8217;s studio became a drawer of motors, buttons, and a tape reader that now scans discarded video tapes in tandem with that bike tire! So for this session I&#8217;d like to lead a conceptual and hands on workshop in which we dream up ways to use discarded electronics (which I will provide). What inventive ways will we think to use an air mattress pump? A robotic aerosol sprayer? A game involving a levitating object? The possibilities are vast and can only improve with a conceptual shift concerning everyday objects.",ok!

Many of us know what it&#8217;s like to witness a new project with cutting-edge tech only to feel disappointed, likening the experience more to a technical demo than something poignant and worth remembering. This may happen with projects of any nature, of course, but tech projects are especially prone to the pitfall of gadgetry taking precedence over meaning.",yes
