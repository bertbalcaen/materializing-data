I&#8217;ve recently come to realize that a large part of my increased comfort level with electronics derives from a shift in perspective; no longer do I simply see a lonely rusted bike wheel littering my neighborhood, but raw materials such as spokes that make great axles for rotating propellers and mirrors. The VCR I found outside my friend&#8217;s studio became a drawer of motors, buttons, and a tape reader that now scans discarded video tapes in tandem with that bike tire! So for this session I&#8217;d like to lead a conceptual and hands on workshop in which we dream up ways to use discarded electronics (which I will provide). What inventive ways will we think to use an air mattress pump? A robotic aerosol sprayer? A game involving a levitating object?
