"VJ demo/workshop",7,"12:00 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 12:00 pm – 1:30 pm","Grayson Earle",10,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/vj-demoworkshop/?instance_id=798,"Since there are so many tools being presented at camp I&#8217;d like to demo a few ways to make them talk to one another. How can you bring a visualization sketch you wrote in Processing into MAX/MSP/Jitter or VDMX? Syphon! How can you control multiple applications at once from a touch screen? TouchOSC! My experience in using these devices and programs is derived from VJing (can we come up with a better term, please?) So we can talk about that, too. I think a fair amount of time at the end will be dedicated to a discussion about using the Kinect&#8217;s raw depth data, but we will not talk about OpenNI as I have no experience with that.","Likely attending!"
"AT&amp;T AdWorks Lab Tour",7,"3:30 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 3:30 pm – 5:00 pm","David Polinchock",30,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/att-adworks-lab-tour/?instance_id=743,"I&#8217;ll give a quick and informal tour of the AdWorks Media Lab.  We&#8217;ll look at how we used Cinder to create some very cool (at least we think so!) data visualizations and explain how we developed the narrative for the entire space.  You can see the pool table that will soon be transformed into a completely, interactive experience!    Lastly, you&#8217;ll also get a sneak peek at the redesign that we&#8217;re currently doing that will launch in September.","Looking forward"

In this lightning session, you will learn how to calibrate a MakerBot, prepare a 3D file (STL) using MakerWare, and then print it on the machines. That&#8217;s all there is to it!",In!
"Smart Dust – is it inevitable?",9,"1:00 pm","June 9, 2013 @ 1:00 pm – 2:00 pm","Alasdair Allan",14,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/smart-dust-is-it-inevitable/?instance_id=766,"I&#8217;d argue that the era of the commodity beige box is coming to an end, and the days of the general purpose computer are almost over. Most people never needed or wanted a computer, and they&#8217;re going to be happy with more limited devices optimised for a single, or a few, purposes so long as those devices just work. Today the black rectangle has replaced the beige box, but don&#8217;t get too comfortable, because it won&#8217;t last as long. Today&#8217;s cellphones and tablets are transition devices, dependent on our current level of technological progress, and around you everyday objects are already becoming smarter.",In

"Intro to Scratch (and Makey Makey)",15,"11:00 am","June 15, 2013 @ 11:00 am – 1:00 pm","Andrew Cerrito",17,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/intro-to-scratch-and-makey-makey/?instance_id=842,"Scratch is a free program geared towards teaching kids introductory programming skills through gamemaking and animation. It can be paired easily with the Makey Makey, an extremely easy-to-use microcontroller that can turn anything into a keyboard. Come check it out!",In

"Coding in Assembly",15,"4:30 pm","June 15, 2013 @ 4:30 pm – 7:30 pm",mail@tristanperich.com,10,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/perich_assembly/?instance_id=831,"Tristan Perich presents an introductory workshop on hardware programming in Assembly, providing an understanding of how these systems function at their lowest level. As the technology in our lives becomes faster and more complicated, our understanding of it has decreased, forcing us to put an implicit faith in its design, inner workings and safety. While Perich&#8217;s work aims to integrate low-level computation with traditional artistic media, this workshop intends to teach a basic understanding of Assembly, a low-level programming language that drives most hardware at its foundation. The workshop is intended for those with a basic understanding of computer programming, though it is not necessary. Participants will learn how to program an Amtel microprocessor, a low-cost, highly versatile microchip similar to those used in Arduino boards and in Perich&#8217;s own 1-Bit Symphony.",In

"Now What?! How to turn your prototype into a product",18,"6:00 pm","June 18, 2013 @ 6:00 pm – 8:00 pm",sarahkrasley@gmail.com,17,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/2282-2/?instance_id=286,"When individuals and companies want to bring their product to the market, they run into hurdles like how to source materials, how to access a group of people who will buy it, and how to do it in a way that it doesn’t eat up all their savings and free time. This session is a crash course in the commercialization arc that includes product development, validation, and commercial ramp up.  Issues that arise in these post-prototype stages are important design insights that will make your product idea stronger. We’ll get into practical examples of how to connect with funding sources, user communities, and manufacturers while sharing resources that’ll be ready and waiting once camp is over.",In
