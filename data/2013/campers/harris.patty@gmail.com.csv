In this session I will go through the history of the quantified self (QS) movement, the existing apps/devices available, ways to hack together your own tools, trends in the industry, and discuss areas that are still untouched by this phenomenon that seems to be the new buzz word of 2013. A year and a half ago my life changed when I began tracking what I ate and how I felt, eventually leading me to cut gluten and dairy out of my diet. Since then I have become immersed in the QS field, helping to co-organize numerous Quantified Self Meetups here in NY, experimenting with dozens of QS tools/apps, and hacking together numerous quantified self tools of my own and in groups with others. By the end of this session participants should have a thorough understanding of the existing QS landscape, be aware of industries ripe for QS development, and be primed with some easy ways to hack together their own projects and tools.",attending

Many of us know what it&#8217;s like to witness a new project with cutting-edge tech only to feel disappointed, likening the experience more to a technical demo than something poignant and worth remembering.
