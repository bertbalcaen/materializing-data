So.cl is a creator network experiment by FUSE labs that provides tools to create, share and browse a range of media like memes, collages, and animated gifs  within people’s existing and new social networks. We’ll give a quick overview of So.cl, and the emerging creative tool app ecosystem built on top of it. We’ll conclude by breaking into groups for micro brainstorms to dream up the creative tools you’d like to have when you leave ITP camp. We’ll close the session with 2 minute lightening presentations by each of the groups.",attending!
