This is a three hour hands on workshop session that should get you beyond the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; stage and leave you with code running on you device and on to the interesting stuff. We&#8217;ll hopefully move on to playing around with the onboard sensors, or perhaps the map and location frameworks, depending on what people in the class would rather do with the time.",coming

Most people never needed or wanted a computer, and they&#8217;re going to be happy with more limited devices optimised for a single, or a few, purposes so long as those devices just work. Today the black rectangle has replaced the beige box, but don&#8217;t get too comfortable, because it won&#8217;t last as long. Today&#8217;s cellphones and tablets are transition devices, dependent on our current level of technological progress, and around you everyday objects are already becoming smarter.",in
