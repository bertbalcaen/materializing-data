I&#8217;ll look at the various hardware options, and do a &#8220;show and tell&#8221; with some of the available hardware that I&#8217;ll bring along for attendees to look over. I&#8217;ll finish off with a live coding demo that&#8217;ll walk people through the basics of sending data to and from an Arduino with the classic hardware &#8220;Hello World&#8221; project; I&#8217;ll blink an LED on and off, but this time I&#8217;ll do it from my iPhone over Bluetooth LE.","Yup. I&#8217;ll have a couple of SensorTags with me for people to have a look at&#8230;"
