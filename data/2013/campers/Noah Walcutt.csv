"Quantified Self: Tools, Trends, and Applications",7,"6:30 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 6:30 pm – 7:30 pm",kh928,20,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/quantified-self-tools-trends-and-applications/?instance_id=244,"When Forbes called 2013 &#8220;the year of the Quantified Self&#8221; at CES it became clear that this is no longer a niche field just for life loggers. In this session I will go through the history of the quantified self (QS) movement, the existing apps/devices available, ways to hack together your own tools, trends in the industry, and discuss areas that are still untouched by this phenomenon that seems to be the new buzz word of 2013. A year and a half ago my life changed when I began tracking what I ate and how I felt, eventually leading me to cut gluten and dairy out of my diet. Since then I have become immersed in the QS field, helping to co-organize numerous Quantified Self Meetups here in NY, experimenting with dozens of QS tools/apps, and hacking together numerous quantified self tools of my own and in groups with others. By the end of this session participants should have a thorough understanding of the existing QS landscape, be aware of industries ripe for QS development, and be primed with some easy ways to hack together their own projects and tools.",in!

General-purpose computing is dissipating and becoming increasingly embedded into our lives. We will soon begin to move in a sea of data, our movements monitored and our environments measured and adjusted to our preferences, without need for direct intervention.","I&#8217;m in!"
