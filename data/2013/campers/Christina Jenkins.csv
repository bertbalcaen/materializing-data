"Teaching Physical Computing",5,"7:00 pm","June 5, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:00 pm",ti8,9,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/teaching-physical-computing/?instance_id=371,"Do you teach physical computing?  Do you plan to teach it? Do you use it in your teaching?  Then this session is for you. There are plenty of people teaching using physical computing methods (electronics, microcontrollers, interaction design, fabrication) at many levels.  Let&#8217;s all get together and trade tips and tricks.",Yess!
"Shop Safety!",6,"5:00 pm","June 6, 2013 @ 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm","Crys Moore",10,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/shop-safety-6/?instance_id=621,"Get Shop certified!",Yess!
"Introduction to Soft Circuits",6,"7:00 pm","June 6, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",kh928,52,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-soft-circuits/?instance_id=779,"In this class, we will go over conductive materials used in creating soft circuits, such as different thread, fabrics, inks and fasteners, along with looking at microcontrollers designed specifically for wearable electronics. Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.",Yess!
"Re-wiring for Re-cycling",13,"6:00 pm","June 13, 2013 @ 6:00 pm – 8:00 pm",kh928,14,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/re-wiring-for-re-cycling/?instance_id=183,"Physical Computing strikes me as a unique opportunity to recycle materials destined for landfill while creating unique objects and experiences. I&#8217;ve recently come to realize that a large part of my increased comfort level with electronics derives from a shift in perspective; no longer do I simply see a lonely rusted bike wheel littering my neighborhood, but raw materials such as spokes that make great axles for rotating propellers and mirrors. The VCR I found outside my friend&#8217;s studio became a drawer of motors, buttons, and a tape reader that now scans discarded video tapes in tandem with that bike tire! So for this session I&#8217;d like to lead a conceptual and hands on workshop in which we dream up ways to use discarded electronics (which I will provide). What inventive ways will we think to use an air mattress pump? A robotic aerosol sprayer? A game involving a levitating object? The possibilities are vast and can only improve with a conceptual shift concerning everyday objects.","I can&#8217;t make it, but wish I could.

"Aerial Photography of Fresh Kills Landfill",22,"all day","June 22, 2013 all-day",nejohnson2@gmail.com,21,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/aerial-photography-of-fresh-kills-landfill/?instance_id=543,"Fresh Kills is one of the most infamous landfills in the United States containing all of New York city&#8217;s waste for over 50 years.  Visible from space and as large as the Great Wall of China, Fresh Kills is a New York secret located in Staten Island and currently being converted into a public park over the next thirty years.  Join us for a field trip to this epic landscape to discover the final resting place of our trash and experiment with aerial photography using kites and large helium balloons.  WIth these grassroots mapping techniques, we can begin to develop a high resolution map of the landfill, investigate vegetation growth and begin to better understand what happens to the things we throw away.",Yess!!
