How can you bring a visualization sketch you wrote in Processing into MAX/MSP/Jitter or VDMX? Syphon! How can you control multiple applications at once from a touch screen? TouchOSC! My experience in using these devices and programs is derived from VJing (can we come up with a better term, please?) So we can talk about that, too. I think a fair amount of time at the end will be dedicated to a discussion about using the Kinect&#8217;s raw depth data, but we will not talk about OpenNI as I have no experience with that.","me, too!"

Most people never needed or wanted a computer, and they&#8217;re going to be happy with more limited devices optimised for a single, or a few, purposes so long as those devices just work. Today the black rectangle has replaced the beige box, but don&#8217;t get too comfortable, because it won&#8217;t last as long. Today&#8217;s cellphones and tablets are transition devices, dependent on our current level of technological progress, and around you everyday objects are already becoming smarter.",Attending.
