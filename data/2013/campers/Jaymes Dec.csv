Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.",attending!

Most people never needed or wanted a computer, and they&#8217;re going to be happy with more limited devices optimised for a single, or a few, purposes so long as those devices just work. Today the black rectangle has replaced the beige box, but don&#8217;t get too comfortable, because it won&#8217;t last as long. Today&#8217;s cellphones and tablets are transition devices, dependent on our current level of technological progress, and around you everyday objects are already becoming smarter.",attending

I&#8217;m excited to share the research that went into my recently published handbook on independent learning called Don&#8217;t Go Back to School, based on interviews with 100 independent learners. Let&#8217;s talk about how independent learning works, and how to get more people doing it and taking it seriously, and how it fits into the future of education, daily life, and the world we want to live in.
