"Seeing Like a Network: Learning to think about digital security",7,"5:30 pm","June 7, 2013 @ 5:30 pm – 8:30 pm",quinn@quinnnorton.com,11,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/seeing-like-a-network-learning-to-think-about-digital-security/?instance_id=632,"This is an interactive workshop in digital security focused on what&#8217;s called &#8220;Threat Modeling&#8221; in the computer security world &#8212; understanding how the networks you use see you, and how to realistically defend against the most likely attacks. We&#8217;ll cover some security tools and techniques, but we&#8217;ll focused making the networked environment legible enough to let you seek out tools and techniques suited to your situation.",Attending
"Sensing our surroundings : log sensor data using arduino",10,"7:00 pm","June 10, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",gabriella.levine@gmail.com,31,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/log-data-using-arduino/?instance_id=522,"This hands on workshop will address visualizing data input from Arduino. The context of the class will be based around open source semi-autonomous sailing robots called Protei, designed to sense &amp; clean oceans. After a brief introduction about Protei project, the remainder of the session will be devoted to understanding the very basics of sensing &amp; exploring the environment through collecting &amp; visualizing data using remote sensors, including sensors such as photocells, potentiometers, and more complex ones like barometers, GPS, and accelerometers.","I&#8217;m coming!"
"&lt;del&gt;Gettin&#8217; jiggy with the GSM shield&lt;/del&gt;",11,"7:00 pm","June 11, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:00 pm",Scott!,19,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/gettin-jiggy-with-the-gsm-shield/?instance_id=914,"The Arduino GSM shield allows you to make and receive voice calls, send and receive SMS messages, and send data over a cellular network.","Will be there"
"Connect iOS &amp; Arduino with Bluetooth LE",12,"4:00 pm","June 12, 2013 @ 4:00 pm – 5:00 pm","Alasdair Allan",29,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/connect-ios-arduino-with-bluetooth-le/?instance_id=278,"This is a one hour crash course on how to get your iPhone (or iPad, or iPad touch) to talk to your Arduino using the new Bluetooth Low Energy (aka the Bluetooth 4.0) standard. I&#8217;ll look at the various hardware options, and do a &#8220;show and tell&#8221; with some of the available hardware that I&#8217;ll bring along for attendees to look over. I&#8217;ll finish off with a live coding demo that&#8217;ll walk people through the basics of sending data to and from an Arduino with the classic hardware &#8220;Hello World&#8221; project; I&#8217;ll blink an LED on and off, but this time I&#8217;ll do it from my iPhone over Bluetooth LE.","Will be there"
