"Arduino Programming Basics",13,"8:00 pm","June 13, 2013 @ 8:00 pm – 9:00 pm","Matt Richardson",31,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/arduino-programming-basics/?instance_id=962,"So if you want to move beyond the blinking LED and learn some more coding for the Arduino, this is the class for you. We&#8217;ll review some of the coding from Arduino 101 and then move onto variables, for loops, while loops, and writing your own functions.","The first Arduino class (Arduino 101) is being repeated right before this one, if you&#8217;re available to take it. Even if you can&#8217;t, I think you can still follow along with this class."
