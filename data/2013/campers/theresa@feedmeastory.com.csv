But how might we use electricity to change the idea of what &#8220;interactive&#8221; books can be? In this session, participants will create pop-up cards that use the affordances of our materials to really investigate how circuits can change the idea of what a book can be. We&#8217;ll also consider where soft circuits are going by looking at examples in toys and wearable technologies.","Looking forward to it"

How can you bring a visualization sketch you wrote in Processing into MAX/MSP/Jitter or VDMX? Syphon! How can you control multiple applications at once from a touch screen? TouchOSC! My experience in using these devices and programs is derived from VJing (can we come up with a better term, please?) So we can talk about that, too. I think a fair amount of time at the end will be dedicated to a discussion about using the Kinect&#8217;s raw depth data, but we will not talk about OpenNI as I have no experience with that.","Thanks for creating this session."

In this session I will go through the history of the quantified self (QS) movement, the existing apps/devices available, ways to hack together your own tools, trends in the industry, and discuss areas that are still untouched by this phenomenon that seems to be the new buzz word of 2013. A year and a half ago my life changed when I began tracking what I ate and how I felt, eventually leading me to cut gluten and dairy out of my diet. Since then I have become immersed in the QS field, helping to co-organize numerous Quantified Self Meetups here in NY, experimenting with dozens of QS tools/apps, and hacking together numerous quantified self tools of my own and in groups with others. By the end of this session participants should have a thorough understanding of the existing QS landscape, be aware of industries ripe for QS development, and be primed with some easy ways to hack together their own projects and tools.","Looking forward to it."
