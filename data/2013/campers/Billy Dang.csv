General-purpose computing is dissipating and becoming increasingly embedded into our lives. We will soon begin to move in a sea of data, our movements monitored and our environments measured and adjusted to our preferences, without need for direct intervention.","I&#8217;m there brah!"
"Coding in Assembly",15,"4:30 pm","June 15, 2013 @ 4:30 pm – 7:30 pm",mail@tristanperich.com,10,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/perich_assembly/?instance_id=831,"Tristan Perich presents an introductory workshop on hardware programming in Assembly, providing an understanding of how these systems function at their lowest level. As the technology in our lives becomes faster and more complicated, our understanding of it has decreased, forcing us to put an implicit faith in its design, inner workings and safety. While Perich&#8217;s work aims to integrate low-level computation with traditional artistic media, this workshop intends to teach a basic understanding of Assembly, a low-level programming language that drives most hardware at its foundation. The workshop is intended for those with a basic understanding of computer programming, though it is not necessary. Participants will learn how to program an Amtel microprocessor, a low-cost, highly versatile microchip similar to those used in Arduino boards and in Perich&#8217;s own 1-Bit Symphony.","I&#8217;m in"
