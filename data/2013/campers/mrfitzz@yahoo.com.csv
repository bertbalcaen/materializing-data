"Introduction to Soft Circuits",6,"7:00 pm","June 6, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",kh928,52,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-soft-circuits/?instance_id=779,"In this class, we will go over conductive materials used in creating soft circuits, such as different thread, fabrics, inks and fasteners, along with looking at microcontrollers designed specifically for wearable electronics. Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.",attending
