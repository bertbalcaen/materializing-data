"Aerial Photography of Fresh Kills Landfill",22,"all day","June 22, 2013 all-day",nejohnson2@gmail.com,21,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/aerial-photography-of-fresh-kills-landfill/?instance_id=543,"Fresh Kills is one of the most infamous landfills in the United States containing all of New York city&#8217;s waste for over 50 years.  Visible from space and as large as the Great Wall of China, Fresh Kills is a New York secret located in Staten Island and currently being converted into a public park over the next thirty years.  Join us for a field trip to this epic landscape to discover the final resting place of our trash and experiment with aerial photography using kites and large helium balloons.  WIth these grassroots mapping techniques, we can begin to develop a high resolution map of the landfill, investigate vegetation growth and begin to better understand what happens to the things we throw away.",ATTENDING.
