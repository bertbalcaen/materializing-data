This is a three hour hands on workshop session that should get you beyond the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; stage and leave you with code running on you device and on to the interesting stuff. We&#8217;ll hopefully move on to playing around with the onboard sensors, or perhaps the map and location frameworks, depending on what people in the class would rather do with the time.",Attending
