"Pop-up books and paper circuits",4,"7:00 pm","June 4, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 9:00 pm",kh928,43,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/pop-up-books-and-paper-circuits/?instance_id=188,"Pop-up engineering is really fun and extremely satisfying &#8211; for adults and for kids. But how might we use electricity to change the idea of what &#8220;interactive&#8221; books can be? In this session, participants will create pop-up cards that use the affordances of our materials to really investigate how circuits can change the idea of what a book can be. We&#8217;ll also consider where soft circuits are going by looking at examples in toys and wearable technologies.","Planning to attend!"

This is a three hour hands on workshop session that should get you beyond the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; stage and leave you with code running on you device and on to the interesting stuff. We&#8217;ll hopefully move on to playing around with the onboard sensors, or perhaps the map and location frameworks, depending on what people in the class would rather do with the time.",Attending!

 This week, we will learn how to make visual content using Modul8.
 We will use a png, a jpg and a movie files to make a moving image using Modul8. This method is a great tool to camp your idea.",Attending!
"Introduction to Soft Circuits",6,"7:00 pm","June 6, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",kh928,52,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-soft-circuits/?instance_id=779,"In this class, we will go over conductive materials used in creating soft circuits, such as different thread, fabrics, inks and fasteners, along with looking at microcontrollers designed specifically for wearable electronics. Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.",attending!

I will begin by showing examples of site-specific and video mapping pieces and then we will map a real building using a spatial scan in Mad Mapper. For homework each camper will get a scan to work from and some tips on how to create giant projections. Part 2 of the session will allow campers to showcase their mapped work projected 3 stories tall on an actual building on broadway.",attending!

We&#8217;ll look at the differences between face detection and face recognition as well as demonstrate examples that track the contours of the face. In addition, we&#8217;ll look at some image processing techniques for face morphing. Examples will be demonstrated in Processing.","Looking forward to this!"
