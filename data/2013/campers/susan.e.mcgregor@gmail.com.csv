Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.","I can&#8217;t come tomorrow night. Any chance there will be a repeat session on this material?"
