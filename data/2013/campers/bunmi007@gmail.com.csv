It is used in performance and installations by artists, composers, and people just like you!",Attending.
"Pop-up books and paper circuits",4,"7:00 pm","June 4, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 9:00 pm",kh928,43,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/pop-up-books-and-paper-circuits/?instance_id=188,"Pop-up engineering is really fun and extremely satisfying &#8211; for adults and for kids. But how might we use electricity to change the idea of what &#8220;interactive&#8221; books can be? In this session, participants will create pop-up cards that use the affordances of our materials to really investigate how circuits can change the idea of what a book can be. We&#8217;ll also consider where soft circuits are going by looking at examples in toys and wearable technologies.","I&#8217;ll be there"

"Introduction to Soft Circuits",6,"7:00 pm","June 6, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",kh928,52,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-soft-circuits/?instance_id=779,"In this class, we will go over conductive materials used in creating soft circuits, such as different thread, fabrics, inks and fasteners, along with looking at microcontrollers designed specifically for wearable electronics. Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.",attending
"Sensing our surroundings : log sensor data using arduino",10,"7:00 pm","June 10, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:30 pm",gabriella.levine@gmail.com,31,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/log-data-using-arduino/?instance_id=522,"This hands on workshop will address visualizing data input from Arduino. The context of the class will be based around open source semi-autonomous sailing robots called Protei, designed to sense &amp; clean oceans. After a brief introduction about Protei project, the remainder of the session will be devoted to understanding the very basics of sensing &amp; exploring the environment through collecting &amp; visualizing data using remote sensors, including sensors such as photocells, potentiometers, and more complex ones like barometers, GPS, and accelerometers.",attending
"Now What?! How to turn your prototype into a product",18,"6:00 pm","June 18, 2013 @ 6:00 pm – 8:00 pm",sarahkrasley@gmail.com,17,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/2282-2/?instance_id=286,"When individuals and companies want to bring their product to the market, they run into hurdles like how to source materials, how to access a group of people who will buy it, and how to do it in a way that it doesn’t eat up all their savings and free time. This session is a crash course in the commercialization arc that includes product development, validation, and commercial ramp up.  Issues that arise in these post-prototype stages are important design insights that will make your product idea stronger. We’ll get into practical examples of how to connect with funding sources, user communities, and manufacturers while sharing resources that’ll be ready and waiting once camp is over.",attending
