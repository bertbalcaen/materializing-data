But how might we use electricity to change the idea of what &#8220;interactive&#8221; books can be? In this session, participants will create pop-up cards that use the affordances of our materials to really investigate how circuits can change the idea of what a book can be. We&#8217;ll also consider where soft circuits are going by looking at examples in toys and wearable technologies.",In!

This is a three hour hands on workshop session that should get you beyond the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; stage and leave you with code running on you device and on to the interesting stuff. We&#8217;ll hopefully move on to playing around with the onboard sensors, or perhaps the map and location frameworks, depending on what people in the class would rather do with the time.","I&#8217;ll be there"

Projects that have been created utilizing these techniques will also be shown. We will then create a simple soft circuit with a switch and that lights up a LED. Attendees will have the chance to learn or expand on basic hand sewing techniques and experience working with new materials and skills.",Attending.

In this session I will go through the history of the quantified self (QS) movement, the existing apps/devices available, ways to hack together your own tools, trends in the industry, and discuss areas that are still untouched by this phenomenon that seems to be the new buzz word of 2013. A year and a half ago my life changed when I began tracking what I ate and how I felt, eventually leading me to cut gluten and dairy out of my diet. Since then I have become immersed in the QS field, helping to co-organize numerous Quantified Self Meetups here in NY, experimenting with dozens of QS tools/apps, and hacking together numerous quantified self tools of my own and in groups with others. By the end of this session participants should have a thorough understanding of the existing QS landscape, be aware of industries ripe for QS development, and be primed with some easy ways to hack together their own projects and tools.",Attending.
"Re-wiring for Re-cycling",13,"6:00 pm","June 13, 2013 @ 6:00 pm – 8:00 pm",kh928,14,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/re-wiring-for-re-cycling/?instance_id=183,"Physical Computing strikes me as a unique opportunity to recycle materials destined for landfill while creating unique objects and experiences. I&#8217;ve recently come to realize that a large part of my increased comfort level with electronics derives from a shift in perspective; no longer do I simply see a lonely rusted bike wheel littering my neighborhood, but raw materials such as spokes that make great axles for rotating propellers and mirrors. The VCR I found outside my friend&#8217;s studio became a drawer of motors, buttons, and a tape reader that now scans discarded video tapes in tandem with that bike tire! So for this session I&#8217;d like to lead a conceptual and hands on workshop in which we dream up ways to use discarded electronics (which I will provide). What inventive ways will we think to use an air mattress pump? A robotic aerosol sprayer? A game involving a levitating object? The possibilities are vast and can only improve with a conceptual shift concerning everyday objects.","I&#8217;ll be there."

As the technology in our lives becomes faster and more complicated, our understanding of it has decreased, forcing us to put an implicit faith in its design, inner workings and safety. While Perich&#8217;s work aims to integrate low-level computation with traditional artistic media, this workshop intends to teach a basic understanding of Assembly, a low-level programming language that drives most hardware at its foundation. The workshop is intended for those with a basic understanding of computer programming, though it is not necessary. Participants will learn how to program an Amtel microprocessor, a low-cost, highly versatile microchip similar to those used in Arduino boards and in Perich&#8217;s own 1-Bit Symphony.","I&#8217;ll be there"

How to turn your prototype into a product",18,"6:00 pm","June 18, 2013 @ 6:00 pm – 8:00 pm",sarahkrasley@gmail.com,17,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/2282-2/?instance_id=286,"When individuals and companies want to bring their product to the market, they run into hurdles like how to source materials, how to access a group of people who will buy it, and how to do it in a way that it doesn’t eat up all their savings and free time. This session is a crash course in the commercialization arc that includes product development, validation, and commercial ramp up.  Issues that arise in these post-prototype stages are important design insights that will make your product idea stronger. We’ll get into practical examples of how to connect with funding sources, user communities, and manufacturers while sharing resources that’ll be ready and waiting once camp is over.","I&#8217;ll be there"
