"Pop-up books and paper circuits",4,"7:00 pm","June 4, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 9:00 pm",kh928,43,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/pop-up-books-and-paper-circuits/?instance_id=188,"Pop-up engineering is really fun and extremely satisfying &#8211; for adults and for kids. But how might we use electricity to change the idea of what &#8220;interactive&#8221; books can be? In this session, participants will create pop-up cards that use the affordances of our materials to really investigate how circuits can change the idea of what a book can be. We&#8217;ll also consider where soft circuits are going by looking at examples in toys and wearable technologies.",attending
"Teaching Physical Computing",5,"7:00 pm","June 5, 2013 @ 7:00 pm – 8:00 pm",ti8,9,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/teaching-physical-computing/?instance_id=371,"Do you teach physical computing?  Do you plan to teach it? Do you use it in your teaching?  Then this session is for you. There are plenty of people teaching using physical computing methods (electronics, microcontrollers, interaction design, fabrication) at many levels.  Let&#8217;s all get together and trade tips and tricks.",attending
"Hello PhoneGap",8,"1:00 pm","June 8, 2013 @ 1:00 pm – 4:00 pm",unknownbot01@gmail.com,37,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/hello-phonegap/?instance_id=149,"The miracle of mobile computing has arrived. Exceedingly powerful computers, seamlessly networked and with a variety of in-built sensors&#8230; all right in your pocket.PhoneGap is an open source framework that lets you program cross-platform mobile phone apps using HTML, Javascript and CSS. Providing a Javascript API to access  the accelerometer, GPS, notifications, and other hardware capabilities of your phone, you can write your code once and deploy the app to Android, iPhone, Blackberry and several other platforms.",attending
"Introduction to the Arduino Yún",8,"4:00 pm","June 8, 2013 @ 4:00 pm – 5:30 pm",ti8,22,http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/ai1ec_event/introduction-to-the-arduino-yun/?instance_id=473,"So you want to network your microcontroller. These days, you&#8217;ve got a lot of options. Here&#8217;s the latest from Arduino, the Yún. This board has the heart of an Arduino Leonardo attached to a WiFi-equipped Linux processor.",attending
